# Project Overview

This is a web-based application that reads RSS feeds. It uses the Google
 Feed Reader API to get the data and display it on a simple web page. The project is mainly used as a way to get familiar with the Jasmine test framework. Tests can be found in `/jasmine/spec/feedreader.js`.


## Instructions

In order to see the RSS feed and run the Jasmine tests, clone or download the repo and then open `index.html` in a web browser.
